Description

This is the first web project in the implementation on the Practicum course through Yandex. It's purpose was to create a webpage featuring many different blocks that describe the different strategies and benefits of learning. Throughout the building of this webpage, several different components were implemented. Different margins, font sizes, and background images were implemented to provide a visually appealing layout. Animations and videos were added to add an interactive effect to the user experience. The videos were embedded with iframe and the animations were implemented wit hthe help of the @keyframes feature. This project was coded with BEM naming and nesting. Like many projects, this project is a work in progress and I am always working to make improvements to enhance the user experience. The instructors at Practicum by Yandex have been very helpful in identifying key ways to make this project better. I take their recommendations and use them to help continuously improve my skills as a developer.
